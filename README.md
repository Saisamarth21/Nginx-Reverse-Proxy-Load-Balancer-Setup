# Nginx-Reverse-Proxy-Load-Balancer-Setup
This project demonstrates how to set up an Nginx server as both a reverse proxy and load balancer. It distributes incoming HTTP requests between two backend servers (with hidden IP addresses) and provides a monitoring endpoint and custom logging to track which backend server handled each request.
